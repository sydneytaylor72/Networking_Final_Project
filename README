Description: A console-based client-server application that implements a 
	simplified chat application using socket programming. The server 
	starts the chat by writing user input to the socket so the client 
	can read it. Then the client will write user input to the socket 
	so that the server can read it. The chat continues with each one 
	waiting for the other's response until the client quits.
Compile: Server - gcc -o server server.c
	 Client - gcc -o client client.c 
Run: Server - ./server {port number}, ex. - ./server 12345
     Client - ./client {host name} {port number}, ex. - ./client fawnlily.cs.uky.edu 12345
Quit: Keyword to close the client connection is "quit"
